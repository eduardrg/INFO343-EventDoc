		<h2 class=content>Setting up your iPad network connection. <h2>
		<p>Set up your network so records can be uploaded to the server. Launch “Settings” (under the “Apps” folder), tap “WiFi”, and join your preferred network. Although you are connected to your local WiFi network, you may need to log in to have access to the Internet. To verify your Internet connection, you can access and refresh a web page in Safari.  If you cannot set up a connection to the Internet, contact your local system administrator.</p>
		<p>1.  Starting a new recording<br/> Hitting the “Start Recording” button on the EventDoc start 		screen creates a new recording, with a unique documentID. Recordings are stored locally on the 		iPad and also uploaded to the EventDoc server. <br/> <br/>
			2.  Resuming previous recording <br/>
			When EventDoc is launched and the previous recording was not completed, you will be prompted to either <br/>
			a. Resume and continue EXISTING RECORD or <br/>
			b. Start NEW RECORD <br/> <br/>
			3.  Automatic Server upload. <br/>
			EventDoc app will attempt to upload recordings to the EventDoc server during the recording process. If upload fails, it will retry.  In either case, the recording is stored locally on the iPad as a backup. <br/> <br/>
			4.  Managing existing records. <br/>
			If necessary, locally stored files can be accessed: <br/>
			a.  via EventDoc admin tool <br/>
			b.  via iTunes <br/>
